# Magic Circle
a simulation of the trigonometric circle in flutter using custom paint for the first time

## what 
this app gives you the angle from the coordinates that you are pressing

## The challenge I faced
the biggest challenge was to convert screen coordinates to angles , also it was pretty amazing to work with radians in every single function
## What's next 
I can turn this code into :
- Circular value displayer 
- Circular slider 
## Features that need to be added
- detect the interaction direction (positive or negative) to change the angle sign
- select from a given range of values
